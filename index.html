									Hi I’m Iryn.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am a multimedia developer with experience in web development, software applications, and UX/UI design. I specialize in creating immersive websites that enhance the digital experience for all users and cater to organizations with a real-world impact.
								</p>
								<p>
									I anticipate a May 2025 graduation from New York University with a bachelor of science in Integrated Design & Media (IDM) and a minor in Computer Science. The IDM program at NYU cultivates a multidisciplinary expertise in emerging technologies and its creative potentials. Through IDM and Computer Science, I have developed a skill set founded in both the technical and creative aspects of website and software development: from interface design, UX research, software testing, back-end languages, and front-end coding.
								</p>
								<p>
									Currently, I am a Web Development intern at Media Art Xploration, where I delve  into website management, updating and redesigning the company’s website in light of their complete rebranding and upcoming productions. In addition, I am Digital Design Co-Chair for the National Pre-Health Community, a non-profit organization that provides educational resources to medical students all around the world. With a team across the country, I work to develop the company's website presence, increasing its credibility in terms of outreach and professional connections. Along with revamping their site, I participate in designing occasional graphics for promotional materials such as business cards, and dabbling in film editing for their 2023 conference promotional video.
								</p>
								<p> 
									In my campus, I am a member of the NYU High Speed Research Network team, a division that provides high speed networking and data applications for researchers around campus to use in their projects with efficiency and reliability. As a developer, I seek opportunities that contribute to a greater impact for a large-scale target audience.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my free time, I enjoy editing videos and producing other digital content on other media outlets. I have started podcasts with my friends, and a youtube channel just for fun. When I am not in front of a computer screen, I love to spend my time at the gym, listening to music and podcasts, and indulging in sweet, caffeinated beverages.

								<h4>
									Overview
								</h4>
								<p>
									May’s Empanadas is a one-woman owned local food-catering service in my neighborhood. Through casual phone calls and texts, the business owner receives orders and supplies homemade batches of empanadas across Queens, New York. Along with other Filipino delicacies, the hearty empanadas spread through word of mouth across the borough, and the owner now receives an abundant flow of order requests from loyal Filipino customers. As a first-generation Filipino college student, I was looking forward to modernizing this business to match the pace of its well-deserved, growing success. 
								</p>
								<h4>
									Goals
								</h4>
								<p>
									Design an interface that allows customers to quickly and effortlessly access products and place orders. <br>
									Design an interface that was equally as efficient for the founder to review orders and make informed business decisions based on customer data. <br>
									Experience Goal: Develop a highly intuitive order application.
									Design Goal: Design a compelling visual brand identity that communicates to its target audience.
									Personal Goal: Shed light to a local business that is close to heart.
